 - fixed minor playback window size calculation bug
 - fixed pause bug
 - made default language selectable

2005-04-06 [1.0.2.4]
 - fixed pause bug again (i.e. should now work in fullscreen mode, too)
 - fixed OSD unpause bug
 - using MPlayer's "-nokeepaspect" option to avoid MPlayer-specific bug with
   non-4:3 displays

2005-04-18 [1.0.4.8]

The road to 1.1
===============

2005-04-24 [1.0.9.9] (pre-release)
 - some fixes in Polish translation
 - MPlayer 1.0-pre7 is out with a fixed DirectSound driver, so DirectSound is
   the default audio output device now
 - native fullscreen mode
 - preliminary support for on-the-fly audio track changing with key 191
   (but be warned, MPlayer is _very_ unstable!)
 - the log window can be used to send MPlayer arbitrary command lines
 - speed control via Ctrl+NumpadMultiply and Ctrl+NumpadDivide

2005-04-25 [1.0.9.11] (pre-release)
 - (unfinishd) playlist support
 - DirectSound device selector in options dialog
   -> MPlayer 1.0-pre7 is now REQUIRED

2005-10-23 [1.1.0.12] (pre-release)
 - complete playlist support
 - integrated a bunch of translations
 - re-designed user interface
 - added status bar with precise timing information; however, the seek bar
   still operates with the old, accustomed percentages, thus avoiding problems
   with some media files (paradigm: displaying wrong times is acceptable, but
   breaking seeks is not)

2005-10-24 [1.1.0.13] (pre-release)
 - reintroduced fsAlwaysOnTop for child dialogs
 - current file name is now displayed in the title bar

2005-10-30 [1.1.0.14] (pre-release)
 - added multi-select in the playlist "add file" dialog

2005-11-15 [1.1.0.15] (pre-release)
 - always-on-top mode wasn't restored when leaving fullscreen mode. fixed.

The 1.1 series
==============

2005-12-27 [1.1.0.16]
 - added simplistic icons
 - fixed some charset issues -- but there seem to be a bunch of others left :(
 - changed the seekbar style

2006-01-30 [1.1.1.17]
 - did NOT fix high CPU consumption bug, and did NOT increase priority level --
   I didn't find a solution for the former one, which effectively makes the
   latter a no-go
 - added .m3u support
 - added volume control
 - fixed broken MPlayer version display in About dialog

2006-02-03 [1.1.2.18]
 - added clip information window (however, almost all translations are missing
   for this window)
 - fixed duration display (MPlayer now uses floating-point times, and I wasn't
   prepared for that)
 - Mute button is now disabled if the clip has no audio
 - double-click on the video now enables full-screen mode,
   single-click toggles pause
 - disabling fullscreen mode mouse cursor with ShowCursor() now, I hope that
   works more reliably than the previous method (SomeWidget.Cursor:=-1;)
 - fixed input box in MPlayer log window (didn't resize with the rest of window)

2006-02-09 [1.1.3.19]
 - now using a Windows XP Common Controls Manifest for styled controls in
   XP's "Teletubbie Mode"
 - built with Delphi 2005 PE now, no more graphical glitches in "Teletubbie
   Mode" (however, development continues to be Delphi6-based, because I can't
   stand that Microsoftish IDE of newer Delphi versions)
 - added two undocumented command-line options: "-fs" enters fullscreen mode
   directly after starting video playback, "-autoquit" quits MPUI after
   playback of the last file finished
 - removed single-click pause functionality; it conflicted with the double-click
   fullscreen mode toggle
 - OpenURL dialog uses the current clipboard contents as the default URL now
 - "Cache fill:" status is now reduced to 1 line
 - Aspect Ratio display in the Clip Info window is now more readable (e.g.
   "4:3" instead of "1.333:1")
 - added error reporting if CreateProcess() fails
 - slightly improved playlist and info window handling, including some docking
 - mouse wheel volume control is now synchronized with the volume slider
 - the MPlayer build delivered with the 4MB .zip file package is now a minimal,
   no-frills, custom-built one and includes the vo_directx 100% CPU usage fix

2006-02-18 [1.1.4.23]
 - screensaver is now disabled in fullscreen mode
 - fixed stupid bug that caused some systems to start up with Belarusian
   language (effectively showing nothing but question marks in the UI)
 - added "higher priority" option. THIS IS ACTIVATED BY DEFAULT, so be warned
   that you'll run into trouble with some graphics cards if you use a
   "off-the-shelf" MPlayer version instead of the one that comes with MPUI
 - added -softvol option, enables playback with volume settings way above 100%
 - whole directories can now be added to the playlist; however, the UI will be
   unresponsive while adding the directories (this will be fixed soon)
 - added fullscreen controls: simple move the mouse to the bottom of the screen
 - added right-click popup menu
 - not using ShowCursor() any longer (like in <1.1.2) because the cursor would
   be invisible in the popup menu in fullscreen mode
 - added "compact mode" (without caption, menu bar and navigation). Note that
   some keyboard shortcuts (Alt+n for example) don't work in this mode.
 - fixed position of some (but not all) keyboard shortcut hints in the menus;
   I hope there are no side effects since this involved a change in the shortcut
   handling system, too
 - changed "always on top" shortcut from Ctrl+T to just T
 - "always on top" mode should no longer interfere with fullscreen mode
 - the technical/internal captions for untranslated controls were changed into
   terse, but clear english ones
 - compiled with Delphi 6 again, because D2005, despite having XP style support,
   got the menus totally wrong: checked items were indistinguishable from
   unchecked ones
 - added the Ukrainian translation I got some time ago, but never integrated

2006-03-18 [1.1.5.27]
 - replaced the main menu by a toolbar that only looks like a menu. This
   resolves a bunch of issues all at the same time:
   - partially white menu bar in XP's Themed ("Teletubbie") Mode is gone
   - most shortcuts line up correctly in the menus
   - keys like T, F or O are no longer mistaken as shortcuts
   - Alt+$x and Ctrl+$x shortcuts work in compact mode
 - playlists and directories can now be specified at the command line
 - all arguments of the command line will be concatenated into a single
   argument string. This helps a bit with broken file associations
   (MPUI.exe %1 instead of MPUI.exe "%1"), but not for file names with two or
   more successive blanks.
   Fix your associations, folks. That's not (yet) my job.
 - fixed the -softvol option (I misinterpreted the MPlayer manpage)
 - made the info button functional
 - fixed typo in options window
 - command box in log window works again
 - added Alt+Enter as an alias for "toggle fullscreen mode"
 - added support for multimedia control keys (Play/Pause, Stop, Previous Track,
   Next Track) on modern keyboards
 - added Bulgarian, Chinese, Italian and Esperanto translation
 - suppressing repeated lines in the log window
 - disabling power management while playing now
 - added "-compact" command-line switch to start up in compact mode
 - ShoutCast/Icecast streamed title tags are now shown in the Info window
 - issuing a warning on Win9x systems now
 - 'S' key makes screenshots now (shot0001.png in the work directory where MPUI
   was started)
 - 'L' key toggles playlist window now
 - the Pause button now acts as a single-step button
 - Shuffle and Repeat playback modes

2006-03-23 [1.1.6.28]
 - added Korean translation
 - fixed mis-positioned shuffle/repeat checkboxes
 - added option to save playlists
 - fixed icon order in video pop-up menu
 - added cache fill indicator (but eats up CPU cycles like hell ... this is due
   to MPlayer's strange behavior, I'm afraid)
 - AutoPlay now plays multiple files and playlists
 - (hopefully) repaired DVD playback (it collided with the recursive directory
   search feature, argh!)
 - mapped Alt+4...Alt+8 keys to popup the main menus
 - MPUI logo is now hidden between files (when multiple files are played)

2006-03-30 [1.1.7.29]
 - fixed mispositioned Save Playlist button
 - added Romanian translation
 - replaced GetWindowsDirectory() by GetEnvironmentVariable("windir") -- one
   user had trouble with the former, so let's hope the latter one works for all
 - window is now always restored when switching normal/fullscreen/compact mode
   (this fixes issues when switching to fullscreen while the window is
   maximized)

2006-04-25 [1.1.8.30]
 - fixed software volume mode (the MPlayer guys made -softvol-max work as
   documented :)
 - updated Simplified Chinese, Polish and Ukrainian translations
 - added Traditional Chinese, Portuguese, Danish, Japanese and Slovak
   translations
 - added code to set up the UI properly if compiled with Delphi versions newer
   than 6.0

2006-06-12 [1.1.9.31]
 - fixed mute disabling itself after volume changes
 - added .flv to autoplay detection
 - enabling previous/next buttons after errors now
 - updated Japanese, Belarusian and Russian translations
 - added Arabic translation (but couldn't test it, sorry)
 - shipping with the brand-new MPlayer 1.0-pre8 now :)

2006-06-22 [1.1.10.33]
 - shuffle mode is truly random now
 - updated Ukrainian and Japanese translation, added Dutch translation
